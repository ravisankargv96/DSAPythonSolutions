Complete programming the known problems. From blind 75.
    1. Write hard Examples, to recall the algorithm with example question.
    2. T.C & S.C, Include comments whereever necessary.

Latex Algo Representation:
    1. Give the function block to chatGPT ask GPT to generate algorithm out of it. (Write your own words)
    2. Convert the Algo to latex format, In overleaf 
    3. Download both .latex & output representation.

Markdown to pseudo code:
    1. The above steps helps in getting pseudo algorithm, Write the algo in 
    2. Download both .ipynb & .md files.

Personal Notes:
    1. Visual representations of Algo.
    2. Write the dry run based on your understanding on a hard example.
        a. Iterate the steps in very detailed manner.
        b. Makesure in future, seeing the dryrun you has to recall the algorithm.
        c. Then mugup the algorithm.
    3. Summarize the approach, mention: corner cases
     

Fill the patterns with 
    1. Algo Representation.
    2. Markdown
    3. Coding.
